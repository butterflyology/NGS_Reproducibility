```{r golobal_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 12, fig.eight = 8, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r Set Seed, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(304957475)
```


```{r example chunk, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
x <- sample(1:100, 5)

```

Last night I saw `r 5 + 2` shooting starts!

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, pch = 19, las = 1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
